/// Provides top-level Ruby services: information about the Ruby VM, evaluate
/// expressions, access various kinds of Ruby objects, and define new Ruby
/// classes, modules, and functions.
///
/// You cannot instantiate this type.  Instead RubyGateway exports a public
/// instance `Ruby`.  Among other things this permits a dynamic member lookup
/// programming style.
///
/// The Ruby VM is initialized when the object is first accessed and is
/// automatically stopped when the process ends.  The VM can be manually shut
/// down before process exit by calling `RbGateway.cleanup()` but once this has
/// been done the VM cannot be restarted and subsequent calls to RubyGateway
/// services will fail.
///
/// The loadpath (where `require` looks) is set to the `lib/ruby` directories
/// adjacent to the `libruby` the program is linked against and `$RUBYLIB`.
/// RubyGems are enabled.
///
/// ## Accessing Ruby objects
///
/// The class inherits from `RbObjectAccess` which lets you look up constants
/// or call functions as you would at the top level of a Ruby script, for example:
/// ```swift
/// import RubyGateway
///
/// print("Ruby version is \(Ruby.version)")
///
/// do {
///    try Ruby.require(filename: "rouge")
///    let html = try Ruby.get("Rouge").call("highlight", args: ["let a = 1", "swift", "html"])
/// } catch {
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you just want to create a Ruby object of some class, see
/// `RbObject.init(ofClass:args:kwArgs:)`.
///
/// ## Running Ruby code
///
/// Use `RbGateway.eval(ruby:)` to evaulate a Ruby expression in the current VM.
/// For example:
/// ```swift
/// let result = try Ruby.eval(ruby: "Rouge.highlight('let a = 1', 'swift', 'html')")
/// ```
///
/// ## Defining new Ruby classes
///
/// Use `RbGateway.defineClass(_:parent:under:)` and `RbGateway.defineModule(_:under:)`
/// to define new classes and modules.  Then add methods using `RbObject.defineMethod(...)`
/// and `RbObject.defineSingletonMethod(...)`.
